                    As you've <i>hopefully</i> read above, I'm currently finishing this website, working on a minecraft modpack and some mods and hopefully soon I find a good open source project to work on.

                    <br><br>

                    Ok more on finishing this <i>darn</i> website, i've been working on <b>this version</b> of the site for about 12 days, and I'm getting pretty close to finishing and not needing to re-do it again, which is really good. Now you may be asking "Oh Liam, why do <b>you</b> need a website", well in all honesty I don't, but I want to do some fun web projects, eg. the url shortener. Also having a domain is a very useful thing, like i can have my own minecraft server with a good server ip that looks like [subdomain].liamsc.net instead of 87.9.193.224:25565 (Btw, that is <b>not</b> mine or anyone elses ip.)

                    <br><br>

                    Ok lets talk about my minecraft mods/modpack, I've always wanted to make a modpack, since I have made mods in the years past (see <a href="https://liamsc.net/about-me">about me</a>), and recently minecraft modded has been really, I don't know how to say this without being 'mean', but It's kinda dead, there hasnt been a big good modded minecraft modpack for a year or so, and I'm not trying to change that, but I personally want something to play, because vanilla, even though 1.8 looks really cool, has been kinda boring in my main world. So I though, meh why shouldn't I just try to make one?!

                    <br><br>

                    Ok let's talk about future projects, My list of future projects are below:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                      <li> My own file explorer (it's an ambitious project, but one that i've always wanted to do)</li>
                      <li>A fully fledged netflix database</li>
                      <li>A centralized notification application</li>
                      <li>And more</li>
                    </ul>
