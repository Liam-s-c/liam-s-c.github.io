        <h1 id="about">About</h1>
        <p>
            With over 30 years’ experience I have gardening in my blood, gaining my qualifications from Pershore College and completing my degree at Birmingham University. <br> My early training was as a gardener at a local stately home (Spetchley Park) where my interest in water gardens and natural stonework developed, along with a desire to learn how to design and build my own gardens. I left to join a renowned landscape company which provided me with the opportunity to work with several hugely experienced and accomplished designers. Here I honed my skills, not only in design, but also in the hands-on construction of the gardens and water features. Having designed and been the lead contractor on over 10 medal winning show gardens, including 5 RHS medal gardens, the time came to go at it alone and I left to start up my own business.
            That was over 12 years ago and here we are today, with a small team of skilled experienced people who are all committed to producing outstanding gardens for our clients to enjoy for many years to come. I believe in supporting local businesses so I will always look to local companies for our supplies and where possible use only local materials such as Forest of Dean or Malvern stone, or Hereford oak timber. I’m also keen to work with local artists and can source original pieces of commissioned artwork made specifically for your garden. Finally, I’m passionate about recycling where possible. All green waste that we remove is stored and composted and eventually reused as a soil conditioner in the gardens that we create. We look to use reclaimed materials where design allows and reduce the amount we dispose of in landfill.

            <h2>Ponds & Water Features</h2>
            <br><br><p><img src="img/Aside - p - img/Ponds and water features.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; padding: 0 0px 0 10px"/>
            I’m inspired by nature. I spend much of my time in the countryside, allowing me to get a first-hand look at how Mother nature moves water through her landscape. My goal is to keep people guessing if my water features are artificial or placed there by Mother nature herself.
            I specialise in creating and maintaining natural looking ponds, waterfalls, streams, fountains and other water features. I can also fully install your own water garden sanctuary. I have seen first-hand how a quality installed pond or waterfall can greatly enhance the quality of life for my clients. Imagine the soothing sounds of running water, the soft glow of underwater lights at night, or being hypnotised by swirling, vibrantly-coloured Koi fish for hours. All of this can be in your very own garden pond or waterfall paradise!

            <h2 style="text-align: right;">Stonework</h2>
            <br><br><p style="text-align: right;"><img src="img/Aside - p - img/Stonework.jpg" alt="" />
            One of the most popular and specialist services I provide is stone walling, whether it be mortared or the traditional dry-stone method of construction. My experienced team use a variety of stone including; natural stone, reclaimed stone, sandstone, limestone and Malvern stone. I can supply all types of stone walling, whether you're after a free-standing wall, a retaining wall, a garden wall or a random or coursed wall. We'll even perfect your wall with decorative finishes. Or maybe you have some existing stonework that is need of repair or maintenance?  Again, I will be able to help!

            <h2>Pathing</h2>
            <br><br><p><img src="img/Aside - p - img/Pathing.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; padding: 0 0px 0 10px"/>
            Choosing a design can be an exciting and difficult task. That’s why I will take the time to discuss your requirements and materials to suit your property. I know you can’t wait to sit in the sunshine, and have a barbeque with your friends and family, which is why I’m dedicated to renovating your garden into a beautiful area that you can enjoy all summer long.
            I specialise in and love to use natural stone paving, with such a wide range of colours and finishes a beautiful piece can be created. However, I also work with concrete based products, including block paving. If you already have a patio, there may be a need for maintenance, such as jet washing, relaying loose paving or repointing, these are all service that I offer.

            <h2 style="text-align: right;">Soft Landscaping</h2>
            <br><br><p style="text-align: right;"><img src="img/Aside - p - img/Softlanding.jpeg" alt="" />
            As qualified plantswoman, I’m just the person to help you when it comes to planting a newly landscaped garden or re-planting an existing garden. I can help you with the design of a planting plan, or maybe you already have a plan and need help with the planting. I have a large range of local suppliers available and can source many plants that you may not have been able to source elsewhere.</p>

            <br><br>
            "
            We asked Pansy to come and have a look at our new property in Herefordshire as the garden had been neglected. She came to discuss our requirements and provided a very competitive quote and produce the most beautiful garden I could have dreamed of. We love to sit out and watch the water bubble over stone sphere.

            Pansy was recommended to me by a colleague. I had been let down by a few companies, so it was refreshing to encounter such a professional and knowledgeable landscaper. Pansy not only knew the materials and how to make them sparkle in our space, but also knew exactly which plants to use to accentuate the divine patios and stairs that she built for us.

            "
            Pansy has designed and planted two gardens for me. One a courtyard garden and the other a little larger with flower beds and a curvy lawn. She made each experience such fun and her sensitive approach to the designs and planting were tailored to my lifestyle. I have been so delighted with both my gardens. They are a joy!
