                    (Don't bully me I was busy, Sheldon was angry at Amy.)
                    <br>
                     Recently I have made lots of changes to a lot of things. 
                     <b>First</b> of all I have made a <a href="https://github.com/liamsc-net">GitHub Organization</a>! 
                     <br>
                     It was created to put my larger projects on there, it makes it easier to manage (and i dont have to put a webhook on all repos)
                     <br> 
                     <b>Second</b> of all I have done 2 <i>big</i> updates to this site, fonts, colors, as well as updating some content and other minor updates.
                     <br> 
                     <b>Thirdly</b>, I have now completely re-written my AHK scripts and code, check it out: <a href="https://github.com/liamsc-net/ahk">Github Repo</a> | <a href="https://liamsc.net/projects/downloads/ahk">Learn more here</a>
                     <br>
                     <b>Fourthly</b>, I now have a <b>Visual Studio Code Theme</b>, check it out and download it: <a href="https://liamsc.net/projects/downloads/vscode-them">here</a>
                     <br>
                     The past couple weeks have been full of planning and working on projects, it's been great to finally get back into programming and be back excited for projects that are upcoming!!!
                     I've done lots of work on my Minecraft ModPack recently as well so thats coming along nicely. 
                     Since I last wrote anything here, there have been a total of <b>127</b> commits to GitHub by me, thats almost 95% of <b>ALL COMMITS</b> this month in just the 17 days that I didn't update this page and 46 of said commits were updating this website! I've redone all my AHK code, I made a visual studio code theme and i've re-watched all 12 seasons of The Big Bang Theory, again.
                     October has been eventful and honestly I'm a little sad that it's going to end, but that's okay, new month, new projects! 
                     And I hope this time I dont miss 17 DAYS of this.
                     <br>
                     Okay goodnight, I hope to write in here again, very soon!!!!

                    Another annoying bug with Windows 11, is that the snap layouts feature, is not OUT for most of the programs that i use, now i know its up to the developers of the applications to add the feature, BUT Visual Studio Code is OWNED by MICROSOFT, WHO OWNS WINDOWS, please just let me use snap layouts with VSCode.

                    Ok, cold is getting a tiny bit better. I updated some things on the website, most notably I added a fade in that lasts one second when you load any page, changed how links look inside of cards and in the content, you see this change a lot @ <a href="https://liamsc.net/about-me">about me</a>, There was an issue where the <a href="https://liamsc.net/img/icon.ico">icon.ico</a> wasnt in the directories, causing the page to not have an icon.

                    I updated y'all yesterday, and I'm doing it again today, look at me go, I fixed and added somethings to a secret project and to the home page (I made it so the cursor when you hover over the coming soon buttons shows an error icon), and I also continued my work on the modpack last night and earlier today.
